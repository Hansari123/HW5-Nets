role in Richard Linklater's black comedy Bernie. He played as real-life murderer Bernie Tiede, a
funeral director in a small East Texas town, who befriends and eventually murders a rich widow,
played by Shirley MacLaine. Black's subdued portrayal, authentic East Texas accent, and musical
talent – he sings several gospel hymns as well as "Seventy-six Trombones" – had Roger Ebert
describing Black's work as "one of the performances of the year."[45] He presented the tribute to
Led Zeppelin when the band was named as 2012 recipients of Kennedy Center Honors.
[46] In 2016,

Won't Get Far on Foot (2018). The film received critical acclaim and starred Joaquin Phoenix,
Rooney Mara and Jonah Hill. He reprised his role in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle's sequel,

On July 14, 2024, Tenacious D celebrated Gass' birthday during their performance at the ICC
Sydney Theater. A birthday cake was brought out and Black encouraged Gass to make a wish. Gass
responded, "Don't miss Trump next time," referring to the attempted assassination of Donald
Trump the day before. Two days later, Black wrote on social media that he was "blindsided" by
Gass' comment and that he did not condone hate speech or political violence "in any form".
Tenacious D canceled the rest of their world tour, and Black said their "creative plans are on hold".
Gass apologized on social media, calling his comment "highly inappropriate, dangerous and a
terrible mistake". Gass deleted his apology later that week.[70][71][72][73]
On December 21, 2018, Black created a YouTube channel called Jablinski Games. Within one week

At age 14, Black struggled with cocaine use. He said, "I was

of AIDS in 1991 at age 36.[105] His oldest brother, Neil

Although an atheist,
[116][117] Black identifies as nominally Jewish, and fatherhood influenced his
decision to raise his children in the Jewish faith.[118]
Black endorsed Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign.
[119] In 2015, he visited Kampala as
part of Comic Relief USA's Red Nose Day.[120] Black is an outspoken critic of Donald Trump. On
the day of Trump's 2017 presidential inauguration, he and Tenacious D bandmate Kyle Gass
performed their 2006 protest song "The Government Totally Sucks". Black said to the audience
beforehand, "We haven't played it for years, because it just never felt appropriate—but now, we're
happy to unleash the beast. The government totally sucks."[121] Before the 2022 election, Black
hosted a letter and text writing party to rally VoteRiders volunteers engaged in educating eligible
voters about voter ID requirements in their states.[122] Of the 2022 midterms, he said, "[S]o much
is on the ballot this cycle. We've got a woman's right to choose. The environment is on the ballot,
environmental protections. And not to mention democracy is on the ballot. There's so, there's so
many divides in this country right now." Black said he viewed a potential reelection bid by Trump
as a threat that is "always lurking in the background."[123]

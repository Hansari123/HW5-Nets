Johnny Depp
John Christopher Depp II (born June 9, 1963) is
an American actor and musician. He is the recipient
of multiple accolades, including a Golden Globe
Award as well as nominations for three Academy
Awards and two British Academy Film Awards. His
films, in which he has often played eccentric
characters, have grossed over $8 billion worldwide,
making him one of Hollywood's most bankable
stars.
[1][2][3][4]
Depp began his career as a musician performing in
several amateur rock bands before transitioning into
film. He made his feature film debut in the horror
film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and
appeared in Platoon (1986), before rising to
prominence as a teen idol on the television series 21
Jump Street (1987–1990). In the 1990s, Depp
portrayed lead roles in Arizona Dream (1993),
What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Benny & Joon
(1993), Dead Man (1995) and title characters Ed
Wood (1994), Don Juan DeMarco (1995) and
Donnie Brasco (1997). He also portrayed Hunter S.
Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
(1998) and Dean Corso in Roman Polanski's The
Ninth Gate (1999). In 1999, Depp received a star on
the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to
the motion picture industry. In the early 2000s, he
appeared in the romance Chocolat (2000), crime
film Blow (2001), action film Once Upon a Time in
Mexico (2003), drama Finding Neverland (2004),
and horror films From Hell (2001) and Secret
Window (2004).
Depp became known for his collaborations with
director Tim Burton, including in Edward
Scissorhands (1990), Ed Wood (1994), Sleepy
Hollow (1999), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
(2005), Corpse Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The
Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), for which he

Caribbean series, starting with The Curse of the
Black Pearl (2003), and reprised the role in four
sequels (2006–2017). For each performance in The
Curse of the Black Pearl, Finding Neverland, and
Sweeney Todd, Depp was nominated for an
Academy Award for Best Actor.
His other well-received films include Public Enemies
(2009), Into the Woods (2014), Black Mass (2015),
and Minamata (2020), among others. He portrayed
Gellert Grindelwald in the Wizarding World films
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of
Grindelwald (2018). He has also lent his voice to numerous animated series in addition to the
animated film Rango (2011). Outside acting, Depp has produced films through his company
Infinitum Nihil, which he founded in 2004. He also formed the rock supergroup Hollywood
Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry. He was named People's Sexiest Man Alive twice, in
2003 and in 2009.[5] In 2022, Depp won a defamation case against his ex-wife, Amber Heard, with
the jury awarding him $15 million[a] and Heard $2 million in her countersuit. The highly
publicized case sparked widespread debate on defamation, domestic abuse, and male victims of
domestic violence, leading to a settlement in December 2022.[9][10]
Depp was born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky,
[11][12][13] the youngest of four children of
waitress Betty Sue Depp (née Wells; later Palmer)[14] and civil engineer John Christopher
Depp.[15][16] Depp's family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Miramar,
Florida, in 1970.[17] His parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15,[17][18] and his mother later
married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called "an inspiration".[19][20]
Depp's mother gave him a guitar when he was 12, and he began playing in various bands.[17] He
dropped out of Miramar High School at 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. He attempted to go
back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a
musician.[17] In 1980, Depp began playing in a band called The Kids.
After modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal,
changing its name to Six Gun Method. In addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd jobs,
such as in telemarketing. In December 1983, Depp married makeup artist Lori Anne Allison,[12]
the sister of his band's bassist and singer. The Kids split up before signing a record deal in 1984,
and Depp began collaborating with the band Rock City Angels.
[21] He co-wrote their song "Mary",
which appeared on their debut Geffen Records album Young Man's Blues.
[22] Depp and Allison
divorced in 1985.[12]
Depp is of primarily English descent, with some French, German, Irish and African American
ancestry.[23][24] Elizabeth Key Grinstead, one of the first African Americans in the North American
colonies to sue for her freedom and win, is an eighth great-grandmother.[24] His surname comes
from a French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700. In
interviews in 2002 and 2011, Depp claimed to have Native American ancestry, "I guess I have some

Native American somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native
American. She grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from
Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek Indian."[25]
Depp's claims came under scrutiny when Indian Country Today wrote that Depp had never
inquired about his heritage or been recognized as a member of the Cherokee Nation.
[26] This led to
criticism of Depp, from the Native American community, as Depp has no documented Native
ancestry,[26] and Native community leaders consider him "a non-Indian"[26][27] and a
pretendian.
[28][29][30] Depp's choice to portray Tonto, a Native American character, in The Lone
Ranger was criticized,[26][27] along with his choice to name his rock band "Tonto's Giant
Nuts".[31][32][33][34] During the promotion for The Lone Ranger, Depp was formally adopted as an
honorary son by LaDonna Harris, a member of the Comanche Nation, making him an honorary
member of her family but not a member of any tribe.[35][36]
Depp moved to Los Angeles with his band when he was 20.
After the band split up, Depp's then-wife Lori Ann Allison
introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage.
[17] After they
became drinking buddies, Cage advised him to pursue
acting.[37] Depp had been interested in acting since reading
a biography of James Dean and watching Rebel Without a
Cause.
[38] Cage helped Depp get an audition with Wes
Craven for A Nightmare on Elm Street; Depp, who had no
acting experience, said he "ended up acting by
accident".[39][40] Thanks in part to his catching the eye of
Craven's daughter,[39] Depp landed the role of the main
character's boyfriend, one of Freddy Krueger's victims.[17]
Although Depp said he "didn't have any desire to be an actor", he continued to be cast in films,[40]
making enough to cover some bills that his musical career left unpaid.[39] After a starring role in
the 1985 comedy Private Resort, Depp was cast in the lead role of the 1986 skating drama
Thrashin' by the film's director, but its producer overrode the decision.[41][42] Instead, Depp
appeared in a minor supporting role as a Vietnamese-speaking private in Oliver Stone's 1986
Vietnam War drama Platoon. He became a teen idol during the late 1980s, when he starred as an
undercover police officer in a high school operation in the Fox television series 21 Jump Street,
which premiered in 1987.[17] He accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest, who
inspired him. Despite his success, Depp felt that the series "forced [him] into the role of
product".[43]
Disillusioned by his experiences as a teen idol in 21 Jump Street, Depp began taking roles he found
more interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office.[43][44] His first film
release in 1990 was John Waters's Cry-Baby, a musical comedy set in the 1950s. Although not a

box-office success upon its release,[45] over the years it has gained cult classic status.[46] Also in
1990, Depp played the title character in Tim Burton's romantic fantasy film Edward Scissorhands
opposite Dianne Wiest and Winona Ryder. The film was a commercial and critical success with a
domestic gross of $53 million.[47] In preparation for the role, Depp watched many Charlie Chaplin
films to study how to create sympathy without dialogue.[48] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised
Depp's performance, writing that he "artfully expresses the fierce longing in gentle Edward; it's a
terrific performance",[49] while Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote that he "brings the
eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the
tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands".[50] Depp earned his first Golden
Globe nomination for the film. Owing to this role, a species of extinct arthropod with prominent
claws was named after Depp as Kootenichela deppi (chela is Latin for claws or scissors).[51][52]
Depp had no film releases in the next two years, except a brief
cameo in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991), the sixth
installment in the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. He
appeared in three films in 1993. In the romantic comedy Benny and
Joon, he played an eccentric and illiterate silent film fan who
befriends a mentally ill woman and her brother; it became a sleeper
hit. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Depp "may
look nothing like Buster Keaton, but there are times when he
genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face, bringing Keaton's
mannerisms sweetly and magically to life".[53] Depp received a
second Golden Globe nomination for the performance. His second
film of 1993 was Lasse Hallström's What's Eating Gilbert Grape, a
drama about a dysfunctional family co-starring Leonardo DiCaprio
and Juliette Lewis. It did not perform well commercially, but
received positive notices from critics.[54] Although most of the
reviews focused on DiCaprio, who was nominated for an Academy
Award for his performance, Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that "Depp manages to command
center screen with a greatly affable, appealing characterization".[55] Depp's last 1993 release was
Emir Kusturica's surrealist comedy-drama Arizona Dream, which opened to positive reviews and
won the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.[56][57]
In 1994, Depp reunited with Burton, playing the title role in Ed Wood, a biographical film about
one of history's most inept film directors. Depp later said that he was depressed about films and
filmmaking at the time, but that "within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was
committed".[58] He found that the role gave him a "chance to stretch out and have some fun" and
that working with Martin Landau, who played Bela Lugosi, "rejuvenated my love for acting".[58]
Although it did not earn back its production costs, Ed Wood received a positive reception from
critics, with Maslin writing that Depp had "proved himself as an established, certified great actor"
and "captured all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny
ability to look at the silver lining of any cloud".[59] Depp was nominated for a third time for a Best
Musical or Comedy Actor Golden Globe for his performance.[60][61]
The next year, Depp starred in three films. He played opposite Marlon Brando in the box-office hit
Don Juan DeMarco, as a man who believes he is Don Juan, the world's greatest lover. He starred
in Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, a Western shot entirely in black-and-white; it was not a commercial
success and had mixed critical reviews. And in the financial and critical failure Nick of Time, Depp
played an accountant who is told to kill a politician to save his kidnapped daughter.

In 1997, Depp and Al Pacino starred in the crime drama Donnie
Brasco, directed by Mike Newell. Depp played Joseph D. Pistone,
an undercover FBI agent who assumes the name Donnie Brasco to
infiltrate the Mafia in New York City. To prepare, Depp spent time
with Pistone, on whose memoirs the film was based. Donnie Brasco
was a commercial and critical success, and is considered one of
Depp's finest performances.[62][63] Also in 1997, Depp debuted as a
director and screenwriter with The Brave. He starred in it as a poor
Native American man who accepts a proposal from a wealthy man,
played by Marlon Brando, to appear in a snuff film in exchange for
money for his family. It premiered at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival
to generally negative reviews.[64] Variety called it "a turgid and
unbelievable neo-western",[65] and Time Out wrote that "besides
the implausibilities, the direction has two fatal flaws: it's both
tediously slow and hugely narcissistic as the camera focuses
repeatedly on Depp's bandana'd head and rippling torso".[66] Due
to the reviews, Depp did not release The Brave in the U.S.[67][68]
Depp was a fan and friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson, and played his alter ego Raoul Duke in
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), Terry Gilliam's film adaptation of Thompson's pseudo-
biographical novel of the same name.
[b] It was a box-office failure[71] and polarized critics.[72] Later
that year, Depp made a brief cameo in Mika Kaurismäki's L.A. Without a Map (1998).
Depp appeared in three films in 1999. The first was the sci-fi thriller The Astronaut's Wife, co-
starring Charlize Theron, which was not a commercial or critical success. The second, Roman
Polanski's The Ninth Gate, starred Depp as a seller of old books who becomes entangled in a
mystery. It was moderately more successful with audiences but received mixed reviews. The third
was Burton's adaptation of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, where Depp played Ichabod Crane
opposite Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from
Angela Lansbury, Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone, saying he "always thought of Ichabod as a
very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a
frightened little girl".[73][74] Sleepy Hollow was a commercial and critical success.[75]
Depp's first film release of the new millennium was British-French drama The Man Who Cried
(2000), directed by Sally Potter and starring him as a Roma horseman opposite Christina Ricci,
Cate Blanchett, and John Turturro. It was not a critical success. Depp also had a supporting role in
Julian Schnabel's critically acclaimed Before Night Falls (2000). His final film of 2000 was
Hallström's critically and commercially successful Chocolat, in which he played a Roma man and
the love interest of the main character, Juliette Binoche. Depp's next roles were both based on
historical persons. In Blow (2001), he starred as cocaine smuggler George Jung, who was part of
the Medellín Cartel in the 1980s. The film underperformed at the box office[76] and received mixed
reviews.[77][78] In the comic book adaptation From Hell (2001), Depp portrayed inspector
Frederick Abberline, who investigated the Jack the Ripper murders in the 1880s London. The film
also received mixed reviews[79] but was a moderate commercial success.[80]

In 2003, Depp starred in the Walt Disney Pictures adventure film
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which was a
major box office success.[44] He earned widespread acclaim for his
comic performance as pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and received
Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations and won a
Screen Actor's Guild Award for Best Actor as well as an MTV Movie
Award. Depp has said that Sparrow is "definitely a big part of
me",[81] and that he modeled the character after The Rolling Stones
guitarist Keith Richards[82] and cartoon skunk Pepé Le Pew.
[83]
Studio executives had at first been ambivalent about Depp's
portrayal,[84] but the character became popular with audiences.[44]
In his other film release in 2003, Robert Rodriguez' action film
Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Depp played a corrupt CIA agent. A
moderate box-office success,[85] it received average to good
reviews, with Depp's performance in particular receiving
praise.[86][87]
Depp next starred as an author with writer's block in the thriller
Secret Window (2004), based on a short story by Stephen King. It
was a moderate commercial success but received mixed
reviews.[88][89] Released around the same time, the British-Australian independent film The
Libertine (2004) saw Depp portray the seventeenth-century poet and rake, the Earl of Rochester.
It had only limited release, and received mainly negative reviews. Depp's third film of 2004,
Finding Neverland, was more positively received by the critics, and earned him his second
Academy Award nomination as well as Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG nominations for his
performance as Scottish author J. M. Barrie. Depp also made a brief cameo appearance in the
French film Happily Ever After (2004), and founded his own film production company, Infinitum
Nihil, under Warner Bros. Pictures.
[90]
Depp continued his box-office success with a starring role as Willy Wonka in Tim Burton's
adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005). It also had a positive critical
reception,[91][92] with Depp being nominated again for the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a
Comedy or Musical.[82][93] Chocolate Factory was followed by another Burton project, stop-
motion animation Corpse Bride (2005), in which Depp voiced the main character, Victor Van
Dort.[94] Depp reprised the role of Jack Sparrow in the Pirates sequels Dead Man's Chest (2006)
and At World's End (2007), both of which were major box office successes.[95] He also voiced the
character in the video game Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow.
[96] According
to a survey taken by Fandango, Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow was the main reason for many
cinema-goers to see a Pirates film.[97]
In 2007, Depp collaborated with Burton for their sixth film together, this time playing murderous
barber Sweeney Todd in the musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007).
Depp cited Peter Lorre's performance in Mad Love (1935), in which Lorre played a "creepy but
sympathetic" surgeon, as his main influence for the role.[98] Sweeney Todd was the first film in
which Depp had been required to sing. Instead of hiring a qualified vocal coach, he prepared for
the role by recording demos with his old bandmate Bruce Witkin. The film was a commercial and
critical success. Entertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty stated that, "Depp's soaring voice makes
you wonder what other tricks he's been hiding ... Watching Depp's barber wield his razors ... it's
hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries

18 years ago ... and all of the twisted beauty we would've missed out on had [Burton and Depp]
never met."[99] Depp won the Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy Actor for the role, and was
nominated for the third time for an Academy Award.
In 2009, Depp portrayed real-life gangster John Dillinger in
Michael Mann's 1930s crime film Public Enemies.
[100] It was
commercially successful[101] and gained moderately positive
reviews.[102][103] Roger Ebert stated in his review that, "This
Johnny Depp performance is something else. For once an actor
playing a gangster does not seem to base his performance on
movies he has seen. He starts cold. He plays Dillinger as a fact."[104]
Depp's second film of 2009, The Imaginarium of Doctor
Parnassus, reunited him with director Terry Gilliam. Depp, Jude
Law, and Colin Farrell each played the character initially portrayed
by their friend Heath Ledger, who had died before the film was
completed. All three actors gave their salaries to Ledger's daughter,
Matilda.[105]
Depp began the 2010s with another collaboration with Tim Burton,
Alice in Wonderland (2010), in which he played the Mad Hatter opposite Helena Bonham Carter,
Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman. Despite mixed reviews, it earned US$1.025 billion in the box
office, thus becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 2010[106] and one of the highest-grossing
films of all time.[107] Depp's second film release of 2010 was the romantic thriller The Tourist, in
which he starred opposite Angelina Jolie. It was commercially successful, although panned by
critics.[108] Regardless, he received Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Golden Globe nominations
for both films.[109]
Depp's first 2011 film release was the animated film Rango, in which he voiced the title character, a
lizard. It was a major critical and commercial success.[110][111] His second film of the year, the
fourth installment in the Pirates series, On Stranger Tides, was again a box office hit,[95] becoming
the third-highest-grossing film of 2011.
[112] Later in 2011, Depp released the first two projects co-
produced by his company, Infinitum Nihil. The first was a film adaptation of the novel The Rum
Diary by Hunter S. Thompson and starred Depp.[113] It failed to bring back its production
costs[114][115] and received mixed reviews.[116][117] The company's second undertaking, Martin
Scorsese's Hugo (2011), garnered major critical acclaim and several awards nominations, but
similarly did not perform well in the box office. In 2011, Depp also made a brief cameo in the Adam
Sandler film Jack and Jill.
By 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars,[118][119] and was listed by the Guinness
World Records as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million.[120] That year, he
and his 21 Jump Street co-stars Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson reprised their roles in cameo
appearances in the series' feature film adaptation.
[121] Depp also starred in and co-produced his
eighth film with Tim Burton, Dark Shadows (2012), alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Michelle
Pfeiffer, and Eva Green.
[122] The film was based on a 1960s Gothic television soap opera of the
same name, which had been one of his favorites as a child. The film's poor reception in the United
States brought Depp's star appeal into question.[123]

After Infinitum Nihil's agreement with WB expired in 2011, Depp
signed a multi-year first-look deal with Walt Disney Studios.
[90]
The first film made in the collaboration was The Lone Ranger
(2013), in which Depp starred as Tonto. Depp's casting as a Native
American brought accusations of whitewashing, and the film was
not well received by the public or the critics,[124] causing Disney to
take a US$190 million loss.[125][126][127][128] Following a brief
cameo in the independent film Lucky Them (2013), Depp starred as
an AI-studying scientist in the sci-fi thriller Transcendence (2014),
which was yet another commercial failure,[129][130] and earned
mainly negative reviews.[125][131][132] His other roles in 2014 were a
minor supporting part as The Wolf in the film adaptation of Into
the Woods, and a more substantial appearance as eccentric French-
Canadian ex-detective in Kevin Smith's horror-comedy Tusk, in
which he was credited by the character's name, Guy LaPointe.
In 2015, Depp appeared in two films produced by Infinitum Nihil. The first was comedy-thriller
Mortdecai, in which he acted opposite Gwyneth Paltrow. The film was a critical and commercial
failure and brought both stars Golden Raspberry nominations.[125][133][134][135] The second film,
Black Mass (2015), in which he played Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger, was better
received.[136][137] Critics from The Hollywood Reporter and Variety called it one of Depp's best
performances to date,[138][139] and the role earned Depp his third nomination for the Best Actor
SAG award.
[140] However, the film failed to bring back its production costs.[125] Depp also made a
cameo appearance in the critically panned London Fields, starring his then-wife Amber Heard,
which was to be released in 2015, but its general release was delayed by litigation until
2018.[141][142] In addition to his work in films in 2015, French luxury fashion house Dior signed
Depp as the face of their men's fragrance, Sauvage,[143] and he was inducted as a Disney
Legend.
[144]
Depp's first film release in 2016 was Yoga Hosers, a sequel to Tusk
(2014), in which Depp appeared with his daughter, Lily-Rose Depp.
Next, he played businessman and presidential candidate Donald
Trump in a Funny or Die satire entitled Donald Trump's The Art of
the Deal: The Movie, released during the run-up to the US
presidential election. He earned praise for the role, with a headline
from The A.V. Club declaring, "Who knew Donald Trump was the
comeback role Johnny Depp needed?".[145] It was also announced
that Depp had been cast in a new franchise role as Dr. Jack
Griffin/The Invisible Man in Universal Studios's planned shared
film universe entitled the Dark Universe, a rebooted version of their
classic Universal Monsters franchise.
[146] One of the severed
zombie heads featured in The Walking Dead season 6 episode "Not
Tomorrow Yet" was based on Depp. Episode director Greg Nicotero
said, "I think we had sculpted an emaciated version of a dummy
head for something and we used Johnny Depp's head as a basis just
for a clay sculpt."[147] Depp reprised the role of the Mad Hatter in
Tim Burton's Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016), the sequel to Alice in Wonderland. In
contrast to the first film's success, the sequel lost Disney approximately US$70 million.[148][125] It
also gained Depp two Golden Raspberry nominations. Depp had also been secretly cast to play

Them (2016), the first installment of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. His name was not mentioned
in the promotional materials and his cameo was only revealed at the end of the film.[149][150]
In 2017, Depp appeared alongside other actors and filmmakers in The Black Ghiandola, a short
film made by a terminally ill teenager through the non-profit Make a Film Foundation.
[151][152][153]
He also reprised his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the fifth installment of the Pirates series,
Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017). In the US, it did not perform as well as previous installments,[154]
and Depp was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards for worst actor and for worst screen
combo with "his worn-out drunk routine".[155] However, the film had a good box office return
internationally, especially in China, Japan and Russia.[156] Depp's last film release in 2017 was the
Agatha Christie adaptation Murder on the Orient Express, in which he was part of an ensemble
cast led by director-star Kenneth Branagh.
In 2018, Depp voiced the title character Sherlock Gnomes in the
animated movie Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes. Although
moderately commercially successful, it was critically
panned[157][158] and earned Depp two Golden Raspberry
nominations, one for his acting and another for his "fast-fading film
career".[159] Depp then starred in two independent films, both
produced by him and his company, Infinitum Nihil. The first was
City of Lies, in which he starred as Russell Poole, an LAPD
detective who attempts to solve the murders of rappers Tupac
Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. It was set for release in September
2018, but was pulled from the release schedule after a crew
member sued Depp for assault.[160] The second film was the
comedy-drama Richard Says Goodbye, in which Depp played a
professor with terminal cancer. It premiered at the Zurich Film
Festival in October 2018.[161] Depp's last film release of 2018 was
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, in which he reprised
his role as Grindelwald. Depp's casting received criticism from fans of the series due to the
domestic violence allegations against him.[162][163]
Depp also experienced other career setbacks around this time, as Disney confirmed that they
would not be casting him in new Pirates installments[164] and he was reported to no longer be
attached to Universal's Dark Universe franchise.[165][166] Depp's next films was the independent
drama Waiting for the Barbarians (2019), which premiered at the 76th Venice International Film
Festival and is based on a novel by J. M. Coetzee.
In Minamata (2020), Depp portrayed photographer W. Eugene Smith. The film premiered at the
2020 Berlin International Film Festival.
[167] In November 2020, Depp resigned from his role as
Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise at the request of its production company, Warner
Bros., after he lost his UK libel case against The Sun, which had accused him of being a domestic
abuser.[168][169][170] He was replaced by Mads Mikkelsen.
[171]
In March 2021, City of Lies, which was originally scheduled for 2018, was released in theaters and
streaming services.[172][173] The same month, an online petition to bring Depp back to the Pirates
franchise, begun four months earlier, reached its goal of 500,000 signatures.[174] His Pirates co-

star Kevin McNally also expressed support for Depp returning to the role.[175] In July 2021,
Andrew Levitas, the director of Minamata (2020), accused MGM of trying to bury the film due to
Depp's involvement,[176][177][178] with Depp claiming he is being boycotted by the Hollywood
industry and calling his changed reputation an "absurdity of media mathematics".[179] Minamata
was released in the UK and Ireland in August 2021,[180] and in North America in December
2021.[181] The film received positive reviews,[182] with multiple publications praising Depp's
performance as his best in years.[183][184][185][186][187] Depp also continues as the face of Dior's
men's fragrance, Sauvage.[188][189]
Depp received multiple honorary awards at numerous European film festivals, including at the
Camerimage festival in Poland,[190] the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech
Republic,[191] and the San Sebastián International Film Festival in Spain,[192] where Depp was
awarded the Donostia Award.
[193] These awards were controversial, with various domestic violence
charities criticizing the festivals.[194][195] The organizers of the ceremonies released statements
defending their decision to award Depp,[196][197][198] with the San Sebastian Film Festival stating
that "he has not been charged by any authority in any jurisdiction, nor convicted of any form of
violence against women".[199]
In September 2021, Depp described himself as a victim of cancel culture.
[200] The same month, he
launched IN.2, a London-based sister company to his production company, Infinitum Nihil, and
announced that IN.2 and the Spanish production company A Contracorriente Films were starting
a new development fund for TV and film projects.[201]
On February 15, 2022, Depp received the Serbian Gold
Medal of Merit from President Aleksandar Vučić for
"outstanding merits in public and cultural activities,
especially in the field of film art and the promotion of the
Republic of Serbia in the world".[202][203] Minamata and
animated series Puffins were shot in the country.[204]
On May 29, 2022, Depp, who was still awaiting a verdict in
his highly publicized defamation trial against ex-wife
Amber Heard, made a surprise appearance at a Jeff Beck
gig in Sheffield, playing guitar alongside Beck to three
classic songs from John Lennon, Marvin Gaye and Jimi
Hendrix. Depp joined Beck on his last concert tour in the UK and Europe during June and July and
in the United States in October and November, to promote their album 18.
[205][206][207] In August
2022, he made a cameo appearance at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards.
[208]
Depp next starred as King Louis XV in French actor-director Maïwenn's period film Jeanne Du
Barry (2023). This was the first film for Depp where he acted in French.[209] The film premiered at
the 2023 Cannes Film Festival as the opening film, where it was greeted with a 7-minute standing
ovation and received a mixed reception from film critics.[210][211][212][213] Many critics deemed it
Depp's comeback role, something he did not agree with.[214]
Modì, Three Days on the Wing of Madness (2024), was Depp's first directorial effort in over 25
years. The film is about 72 hours in the life of Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani, and Depp co-
produced it through his European company IN.2 Film, alongside Al Pacino.
[215] It stars Riccardo
Scamarcio, Stephen Graham, Al Pacino and Antonia Desplat, and it is based on a play by Dennis
McIntyre.[215] Principal photography commenced in September 2023 in Budapest, Hungary and

Depp performing with the
Hollywood Vampires at
Wembley Arena in 2018
was completed in Los Angeles and Turin in early 2024.[216][217][218] The film premiered at the 72nd
San Sebastián International Film Festival on September 24, 2024, where it was received warmly by
the audience with a lengthy standing ovation.[219][220]
In 2004, Depp founded film production company Infinitum Nihil to develop projects where he will
serve as actor or producer.[90] He serves as its CEO, while his sister, Christi Dembrowski, serves as
president.[90][221] The company's first two film releases were The Rum Diary (2011) and Hugo
(2011).[222] A European sister-company to Infinitum Nihil, entitled IN.2, was launched in
September 2021. In a press release, Depp stated: "From the student to the maestro, from the
aspiring artists to the yet-knowns, to the well-established great masters across all forms of modern
media, IN.2 will build a space where artists can be artists, where they will be free to create those
unexpected moments, those happy accidents that contain the propensity to constitute great art and
so bring their unique vision to life."[223]
Depp co-owned the nightclub The Viper Room in Los Angeles from 1993 to 2003,[224] and he was
also part owner of the restaurant-bar Man Ray in Paris for a short period of time.[225] Depp and
Douglas Brinkley edited folk singer Woody Guthrie's novel House of Earth,
[226] which was
published in 2013.[227]
Prior to his acting career, Depp was a guitarist, and has later
featured on songs by Oasis, Shane MacGowan, Iggy Pop, Vanessa
Paradis, Aerosmith, Marilyn Manson, and The New Basement
Tapes, among others. He also performed with Manson at the
Revolver Golden Gods Awards in 2012.[228] Depp played guitar on
the soundtrack of his films Chocolat and Once Upon a Time in
Mexico, and has appeared in music videos for Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers, The Lemonheads, Avril Lavigne and Paul
McCartney. In the 1990s, he was also a member of P, a musical
group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes, Red Hot
Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones.
In 2014, Depp joined Aerosmith on stage at the Xfinity Center in
Mansfield.[229]
In 2015, Depp formed the supergroup Hollywood Vampires with
Alice Cooper and Joe Perry; the band also includes Bruce Witkin,
his friend from his 1980s band, The Kids. Hollywood Vampires
released their self-titled debut studio album in September 2015. It
featured eleven classic rock covers, as well as three original songs (all co-written by Depp).[230] The
band made their live debut at The Roxy in Los Angeles in September 2015,[231] and has since done
three world tours in 2016,[232] 2018[233][234] and 2023.[235][236] Their second studio album, Rise,
was released in June 2019 and consists mostly of original material, including songs written by
Depp. The album also features a cover version of David Bowie's "Heroes", sung by Depp.[237]

In 2020, Depp released a cover of John Lennon's "Isolation" with guitarist Jeff Beck, and stated
that they would be releasing more music together in the future.[238] Beginning in May 2022, Depp
joined Beck onstage for a number of concerts in the United Kingdom, where Beck announced they
had recorded an album together.[239] Their joint record, titled 18, was released on July 15, 2022.
Depp also accompanied Beck on his last European and American tours, which began in June and
ended in November.[240] In May 2023, Depp performed at the Jeff Beck tribute concerts held at
the Royal Albert Hall in London, sharing the stage with Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood
and Kirk Hammett among others.[241][242]
On July 17, 2024, Depp was a special guest at one of the three Andrea Bocelli 30th anniversary
concerts. Together, Depp and Bocelli performed the song "En Aranjuez Con Tu Amor" in honor of
Jeff Beck. Depp played the guitar, while Bocelli sang. Other guests included Will Smith, Ed
Sheeran, Russell Crowe, Brian May, Jon Batiste and Laura Pausini.
[243]
In July 2022, artwork made by Depp sold out less than a day since it debuted in the art retailer
Castle Fine Art in London's Covent Garden. The art house hosted his "Friends & Heroes"
collection, which was described as paintings of people "who have inspired him as a person". Among
the art pieces, the names include actors Al Pacino and Elizabeth Taylor and musicians Bob Dylan
and Keith Richards. Depp made for nearly $4 million and sold 780 prints through the art house's
37 galleries. Ahead of the sale, Depp expressed his desire to display his art publicly and stated, "I've
always used art to express my feelings and to reflect on those who matter most to me, like my
family, friends and people I admire." He added, "My paintings surround my life, but I kept them to
myself and limited myself. No one should ever limit themselves."[244] All 780 pieces sold within
hours, with framed individual images going for £3,950 and the complete portfolio of four images
selling for £14,950. "This world-first release proved to be our fastest-selling collection to date, with
all titles selling out in just hours", the gallery announced on Instagram. Speaking on behalf of fine
art publishers, Washington Green Glyn Washington described Depp as a "true creative, with an
extraordinary eye for detail and nuance".[245][246]
A second installment in the "Friends & Heroes" collection, this time entitled "Friends & Heroes II"
was released in March 2023. Prints of public figures Heath Ledger, Bob Marley, River Phoenix and
Hunter S. Thompson were made available for sale, as a four-piece, and signed by Depp, or sold
individually.[247] In July 2023, Depp unveiled an auto portrait, entitled "Five" which he had
painted in 2021. The meaning of the number five is, according to Depp, linked the fact that he was
about to enter the fifth year of a dark phase in his life. Depp spoke about the difficulty in creating a
self-portrait, stating: "It's not the most comfortable thing doing a self-portrait. Although, in a weird
way, almost everything you do is a self-portrait in one way or another." The collections were once
again hosted by Castle Fine Art gallery.[248]
Depp opened his first art exhibition A Bunch of Stuff on October 4, 2024, at the Starrett–Lehigh
Building in New York City. The exhibition features artworks created by Depp over many decades,
with some dating back to his 20s. On September 30, 2024, a special preview event took place, with
Depp and some of his friends and family members present, including Jim Jarmusch, Jerry
Bruckheimer and Justin Bartha.

In the 1990s, Depp was seen as a new type of male film star that rejected the norms of that
role.[251][252] After becoming a teen idol in 21 Jump Street,
[253] he publicly protested against the
image, and with his subsequent film and public relations choices began to cultivate a new public
persona.[251][252] The Sydney Morning Herald characterized Depp in the 1990s as the "bad boy of
Hollywood";[254] Depp's chain smoking,
[254] recreational drug use and drinking habits were
generally documented during this time.[255] According to The Guardian journalist Hadley
Freeman in 2020:
Along with Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, he was part of a holy trinity of grunge heart-
throbs. They were the opposite of the Beverly Hills, 90210 boys, or Brad Pitt and
DiCaprio, because they seemed embarrassed by their looks, even resentful of them. ...This
uninterest in their own prettiness made them seem edgy, even while their prettiness
softened that edge. They signified not just a different kind of celebrity, but a different kind
of masculinity: desirable but gentle, manly but girlish. Depp in particular was the cool
pinup it was safe to like, and the safe pinup it was cool to like. We fans understood that
there was more to Depp, Phoenix and Reeves than handsomeness. They were artistic—
they had bands!—and they thought really big thoughts, which they would ramble on about
confusingly in interviews. If we dated them, we understood that our role would be to
understand their souls.[251]
Similarly, film scholar Anna Everett has described Depp's 1990s films and public persona as "anti-
macho" and "gender-bending", going against the conventions of a Hollywood leading man.[252]
After 21 Jump Street, Depp chose to work in independent films, often taking on quirky roles that
sometimes even completely obscured his looks, such as Edward Scissorhands.
[251][252] Critics
often described Depp's characters as "iconic loners"[44] or "gentle outsiders".[252] According to
Depp, his onetime agent, Tracey Jacobs of United Talent Agency (UTA), had to take "a lot of heat
over the years" for his role choices; Depp characterized higher-ups at UTA as thinking, "Jesus
Christ! When does he do a movie where he kisses the girl? When does he get to pull a gun out and
shoot somebody? When does he get to be a man for a change? When is he finally going to do a
blockbuster?".[256] According to Everett, his "rule-breaking" roles matched with the "much
publicized rebelliousness, unconventionality, and volatility ascribed to Depp's own personal life
throughout the decade. From reports of his repeated confrontations with the police, trashing of a
hotel room, chain smoking, drinking, and drug use, to his multiple engagements to such glamorous
women as supermodel Kate Moss and Hollywood starlet Winona Ryder and others, we clearly see a
perfect fit between his non-conformist star image and his repertoire of outsider characters".[252]
After a decade of appearing mainly in independent films with varying commercial success, Depp
became one of the biggest box-office draws in the 2000s with his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in
Walt Disney Studios' Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.[257] The five films in the series have
earned US$4.5 billion as of 2021. In addition to the Pirates franchise, Depp also made four further
films with Tim Burton that were major successes, with one, Alice in Wonderland (2010), becoming
the biggest commercial hit of Depp's career and one of the highest-grossing films in history (as of
2021).[258] In 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars,[118][119] and was listed by the
Guinness World Records as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million in a
year.[120]

According to film scholar Murray Pomerance, Depp's
collaboration with Disney "can be seen to purport and
herald a new era for Johnny Depp, one in which he is,
finally, as though long-promised and long-expected, the
proud proprietor of a much-accepted career; not only a star
but a middle-class hero".[257] In 2003, the same year as the
first film in the Pirates series was released, Depp was
named "World's Sexiest Man" by People; he would receive
the title again in 2009.[257] During the decade and into the
2010s, Depp was one of the biggest and most popular film
stars in the world[118][119] and was named by public vote as
"Favorite Male Movie Star" at the People's Choice Awards
every year for 2005 through 2012. In 2012, Depp became
the highest-paid actor in the American film industry,
earning as high as $75 million per film,[120] and as of
2020, is the tenth highest-grossing actor worldwide, with his films having grossed over US$3.7
billion at the United States box office and over US$10 billion worldwide.[259] Although a
mainstream favorite with the audiences, critics' views on Depp changed in the 2000s, becoming
more negative as he was seen to conform more to the Hollywood ideal.[257] Regardless, Depp
continued to eschew more traditional leading-man roles until towards the end of the 2000s, when
he starred as John Dillinger in Public Enemies (2009).[257]
In the 2010s, Depp's films were less successful, with many big-budget studio films such as Dark
Shadows (2012), The Lone Ranger (2013), and Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016)
underperforming at the box office.[125][123][128][129] Depp also received negative publicity due to
allegations of domestic violence, substance abuse, poor on-set behavior and the loss of his US$650
million fortune.[260][261][262][263][251] After losing a highly publicized libel trial against the
publishers of The Sun, Depp was asked to resign from Warner Bros.' Fantastic Beasts
franchise.[168] Many publications alleged that Depp would struggle to find further work in major
studio productions in the future.[264][251][265]
Depp owns a property in West Hollywood and currently lives in London. By February 2023, he had
not yet bought a property there, instead choosing to either stay at hotels or at friends' houses.[266]
Depp married Lori Anne Allison on December 24, 1983, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, when he
was 20 and she was 25.[267][268] She was the sister of his rock band's bassist.[269] The couple
moved to Los Angeles County, California to pursue careers in music; Depp found some success
with his group The Kids, opening for the Ramones and Iggy Pop, but Allison's career as a record
producer was halted after she became deaf in one ear, prompting her to pursue a career as a
makeup artist for film and television.[269] Through her connections, Allison was able to introduce
Depp to Nicolas Cage. Cage was impressed by Depp and arranged for him to audition for A
Nightmare on Elm Street, which became his first film credit.[270] After two years of marriage, their

divorce finalized on March 7, 1986.[271] Depp and Allison remained friendly over the years, with
her still using Depp as her professional surname and voicing sympathy for him during his
defamation trial against his second wife Amber Heard.
[272]
In the late 1980s, he was engaged to actresses Jennifer Grey and Sherilyn Fenn.
[251] In 1990, he
proposed to his Edward Scissorhands co-star Winona Ryder, whom he had begun dating the year
prior when she was 17 and he was 26.[273][274] They ended their relationship in 1993;[273] Depp
later had the "Winona Forever" tattoo on his right arm changed to "Wino Forever".[251] Between
1994 and 1998, he was in a relationship with English model Kate Moss.
[275] Following his breakup
with Moss, Depp began a relationship with French actress and singer Vanessa Paradis, whom he
met while filming The Ninth Gate in France in 1998. They have two children, daughter Lily-Rose
Melody Depp (born 1999) and a son, Jack (born 2002).[276] Depp stated that having children has
given him a "real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything ...You
cannot plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision.
It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny. All the math finally worked."[81] In June
2012, Depp and Paradis announced their separation.[277]
Following the end of his relationship with Vanessa Paradis, Depp began dating actress Amber
Heard, with whom he had co-starred in The Rum Diary (2011).[278] Depp and Heard were married
in a civil ceremony on February 3, 2015.[279][280][281] Heard filed for divorce on May 23, 2016, and
obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp, alleging in her court declaration that he had
been verbally and physically abusive throughout their relationship, usually while under the
influence of drugs or alcohol.[282][283][284][263] Depp denied these claims and alleged that she was
"attempting to secure a premature financial resolution".[285][282][286] A settlement was reached in
August 2016,[287] and the divorce was finalized in January 2017.[288] Heard dismissed the
restraining order, and they issued a joint statement saying that their "relationship was intensely
passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false
accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm".[287]
Depp paid Heard a divorce settlement of US$7 million, which she pledged to donate[289] to the
ACLU[290] and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA).[291][292]
Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd
In 2018,[293] Depp brought a libel lawsuit in the UK against News Group Newspapers (NGN),
publishers of The Sun, over an April 2018 article titled "GONE POTTY How Can J K Rowling be
"genuinely happy" casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts
film?".[294][295][296] The case had a highly publicized trial in July 2020, with both Depp and Heard
testifying for several days.[297] Depp's lawyer, David Sherborne, said that Heard had "blatantly
lied" in her evidence while NGN's lawyer, Sasha Wass, said that "all the evidence in [the] case and
all the supporting evidence of the incidents of violence" leave "no doubt that Mr. Depp regularly
and systematically abused his wife".[298]
In November 2020, the High Court of Justice ruled that 12 of the 14 incidents of physical violence
alleged by NGN occurred and that in three of them, Depp had put Heard "in fear of her
life".[295][296] The court rejected Depp's claim of a hoax as well as his characterization of Heard as
Legal issues and allegations

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_

a "gold-digger".[299] On the other hand, the court found that the characterization of Depp as a
"wife beater" by The Sun was "substantially true".[295][296] Following the verdict, Depp resigned
from the Fantastic Beasts franchise after being asked to do so by its production company, Warner
Bros.[170]
Depp appealed the verdict, with his lawyers accusing Heard of not following through on a pledge to
donate her divorce settlement to charity, contrary to her testimony. Depp's lawyers also asserted
that Heard's donation testimony had significantly influenced the judge's view of Heard.[300] In
response, Heard's legal team stated that she had not yet finished paying her pledged donation due
to the financial burden of the lawsuits against her by Depp and that Depp was using this to "divert
attention from the UK Court's findings relating to allegations of Mr. Depp committing domestic
abuse and violence".[300][301] Depp's appeal to overturn the verdict was rejected by the England
and Wales Court of Appeal in March 2021,[302] with the Court concluding:[303][304]
We do not accept that there is any ground for believing that the judge may have been
influenced by any such general perception as [Depp's lawyer] relies on. In the first place,
he does not refer to [Heard's] charitable donation at all in the context of his central
findings. On the contrary, he only mentions it in a very particular context... and after he
had already reached his conclusions in relation to the 14 incidents... It is clear from a
reading of the judgment as a whole that the judge based his conclusions on each of the
incidents on his extremely detailed review of the evidence specific to each incident. ... In
an approach of that kind there was little need or room for the judge to give weight to any
general assessment of Ms. Heard's credibility... we conclude that the appeal has no real
prospect of success.
Depp v. Heard
In February 2019, Depp sued Heard for defamation over a December 2018 op-ed for The
Washington Post.
[305][306][307] The lawsuit ultimately resulted in Depp alleging that the op-ed
contained three defamatory statements: first, its headline, "Amber Heard: I spoke up against
sexual violence — and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change"; second, Heard's writing:
"Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force
of our culture's wrath for women who speak out"; and third, Heard's writing: "I had the rare
vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse."[6][308] Depp
alleged that he had been the one who was abused by Heard, that her allegations constituted a hoax
against him, and that as a consequence, Disney had declined to cast him in future
projects.[305][307]
Heard countersued Depp in August 2020, alleging that he had coordinated "a harassment
campaign via Twitter and [by] orchestrating online petitions in an effort to get her fired from
Aquaman and L'Oreal".[309][310] Ultimately, Heard's counter-suit went to trial over three
allegations that Depp had defamed her through statements made by his then-lawyer, Adam
Waldman, published in the Daily Mail in April 2020: first, Waldman stated that "Heard and her
friends in the media used fake sexual violence allegations as both sword and shield", publicizing a
"sexual violence hoax" against Depp; second, Waldman stated that in one incident at a penthouse,
"Amber and her friends spilled a little wine and roughed the place up, got their stories straight
under the direction of a lawyer and publicist, and then placed a second call to 911" as a "hoax"
against Depp; third, Waldman stated that there had been an "abuse hoax" by Heard against
Depp.[6][7]

In October 2020, the judge in the case dismissed Depp's lawyer Adam Waldman after he leaked
confidential information covered by a protective order to the media.[264][311] Following the verdict
in Depp's lawsuit against The Sun the next month, Heard's lawyers filed to have the defamation
suit dismissed, but Judge Penny Azcarate ruled against it because Heard had not been a party in
the UK case.[312] In August 2021, a New York judge ruled that the ACLU must disclose documents
related to Heard's charity pledge to the organization.[313][314]
The Depp v. Heard trial took place in Fairfax County, Virginia from April 11 to June 1, 2022.
During the trial, Heard accused Depp of domestic abuse, stating that Depp "plunged into the
depths of paranoia and violence after binging on drugs and alcohol" during their relationship. On
the other hand, Depp accused Heard of several instances of physical and verbal abuse during their
relationship.[263][315][287][316]
On June 1, 2022, the jury returned a verdict after 13 hours of deliberation. In their verdict, the jury
found that all three statements from Heard's op-ed were false, defamed Depp, and were made with
actual malice.
[317] The jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in
punitive damages,[6][7] although the punitive damages were reduced to $350,000 due to a limit
imposed by an existing Virginia state law.[318] For Heard's counter-suit, the jury found that
Waldman's first and third statements to the Daily Mail were not defamatory, while finding that
Waldman's second statement to the Daily Mail was false, defamatory, and made with actual
malice.[7] As a result, Heard was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and zero in
punitive damages from Depp.[6]
Depp reacted to the result of the trial by declaring that the "jury gave me my life back. I am truly
humbled."[319] Depp also stated that he was "overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and the
colossal support and kindness from around the world". He continued: "I hope that my quest to
have the truth be told will have helped others, men or women, who have found themselves in my
situation, and that those supporting them never give up."[320] Depp also highlighted "the noble
work of the Judge, the jurors, the court staff and the Sheriffs who have sacrificed their own time to
get to this point", and praised his "diligent and unwavering legal team" for "an extraordinary
job".[321]
After they filed to appeal the verdict, Heard and Depp settled the case in December 2022, with
Heard maintaining that the settlement was "not an act of concession"; meanwhile Depp's lawyers
stated that the "jury's unanimous decision and the resulting judgement in Mr. Depp's favor against
Ms. Heard remain fully in place", and that the settlement would result in $1 million being paid to
Depp, which "Depp is pledging and will donate to charities".[322][323]
Depp was arrested in Vancouver in 1989 for assaulting a security guard after the police were called
to end a loud party at his hotel room.[324] When later asked about the incident in 1991, Depp
stated: "The guy had a boner for me... He had a wild hair up his ass, and he got real mouthy with
me, saying, 'I know who you are, but you can't come up unless you're a guest here.' The mistake he
eventually made was to put his hands on me. I pushed him back, and then we sort of wrestled
around a bit, and I ended up spittin' in his face."[325]
Depp was also arrested in New York City in 1994 after causing significant damage to his room at
The Mark Hotel, where he was staying with Kate Moss, his girlfriend. The charges were dropped
against him after he agreed to pay US$9,767 in damages.[326]
Other legal issues and allegations

Depp 17/55
Depp was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazi, when the photographers tried to take
his picture. He allegedly threatened them with a wooden plank when they approached him outside
Mirabelle restaurant in central London on an early Sunday morning.[327]
In 2012, UC Irvine medical professor Robin Eckert sued Depp and three security firms, Premier
Group International, Damian Executive Production Inc. and Staff Pro Inc.,[328] claiming to have
been roughed up by his bodyguards at a concert in Los Angeles in 2011. During the incident, she
was allegedly hand-cuffed and dragged 40 feet across the floor, resulting in injuries including a
dislocated elbow. Depp's attorneys contended that Eckert provoked the alleged assault and
therefore "consented to any assault and battery".[329] Eckert's court papers stated that Depp,
despite being his security guards' direct manager, did nothing to stop the attack.[330] Before the
case went to trial, Depp settled with Eckert for an undisclosed sum, according to TMZ.[331]
In April 2015, Depp and his then-wife Amber Heard breached Australia's biosecurity laws when
they failed to declare their two dogs to the customs when they flew to Queensland, where he was
working on a film.[332][333] Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents, stating that
she had made a mistake due to sleep deprivation.[334] She was placed on a $1,000 one-month good
behavior bond for producing a false document;[335] Heard and Depp also released a video in which
they apologized for their behavior and urged people to adhere to the biosecurity laws.[335] The
Guardian called the case the "highest profile criminal quarantine case" in Australian history.[335]
In March 2016, Depp cut ties with his management company, The Management Group (TMG), and
sued them in January 2017 for alleged embezzlement and for allegedly improperly managing his
money and leaving him over $40 million in debt.[336][337] TMG stated that Depp was responsible
for his own fiscal mismanagement and countersued him for unpaid fees.[336][338] In a related suit,
Depp also sued his lawyers, Bloom Hergott, in January 2017.[339] Both lawsuits were settled, the
former in 2018 and the latter in 2019.[339][340][336]
In 2018, two of Depp's former bodyguards sued him for unpaid wages and unsafe working
conditions.[341] Among other complaints, the two bodyguards claimed in their suit that they were
required to perform tasks that were beyond the scope of their capacity as bodyguards, including
being asked to repeatedly drive vehicles that "contained illegal substances, open containers and
minors".[342][343] Despite this and despite being exposed to other unsafe working conditions while
putting in 12-hour work shifts on the job without rest or meal breaks, the bodyguards added, they
were neither paid overtime nor otherwise fairly or lawfully compensated.[341][342] The suit was
settled in 2019.[344]
Also in 2018, Depp was sued for allegedly hitting and verbally insulting a crew member while
under the influence of alcohol on the set of City of Lies.
[345] A lawyer for Depp told the media that
"Depp never touched the [crew member], as over a dozen witnesses present will attest";
meanwhile, Depp's legal team entered a court filing that did not admit that Depp hit the crew
member, but stated that the crew member "provoked" the incident with "unlawful and wrongful
conduct", causing Depp and film director Brad Furman to fear for their safety.[346] A film script
supervisor submitted a court declaration that Depp did not hit the crew member, and only scolded
him.[347] Before the lawsuit went to trial, a tentative settlement regarding the dismissal of the
lawsuit was reached between Depp and the crew member in July 2022.[347]
In August 2022, Depp and Jeff Beck were accused of stealing an incarcerated African American
man's poem by incorporating its verses into the lyrics to their song "Sad Motherfuckin' Parade" in
their 2022 collaborative album, 18. Bruce Jackson, the folklorist who made the accusation,
4/24/25, 8:30 PM Johnny Depp - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_
Depp 18/55
requested that Depp and Beck give due credit to Slim Wilson, the actual originator of the lyrics, for
the song. He also requested that if any profits are made from the album, the two should donate
them to an organization that aids African Americans.[348] In response, Depp and Beck sued
Jackson, claiming that "Sad Motherfuckin' Parade" is an "original work of authorship and
creativity" and that Jackson's accusation amounts to a cash grab. Jackson responded by noting that
he had never made any "formal financial demands" and, while maintaining that Depp and Beck
never wrote the lyrics to that song, said that them suing the person who caught them stealing the
lyrics is akin to "a burglar suing a homeowner because he cut his hand on the kitchen window he
broke getting in".[349] This lawsuit is still ongoing.
In January 2024, actress Lola Glaudini, on an episode of the podcast Powerful Truth Angels,
recounted an incident of verbal abuse from Depp during the shooting of the movie Blow
(2001).[350] According to Glaudini, she had been told by the film's director, Ted Demme, to "burst
out laughing" on cue to a line from Depp during the filming of a scene for the movie. In one take,
after several others of her following this direction, Glaudini continued:[351]
I hear the cue, and I go hahaha, I do a big laugh or whatever... Johnny Depp, when they
say cut, walks over to me, comes up to me, sticks his finger in my face—and I'm in a bikini
on the ground like this—and he comes over and he goes, "Who the fuck do you think you
are? Who the fuck do you think you are? Shut the fuck up. I'm out here, and I'm trying to
fucking say my lines and you're fucking pulling focus. You fucking idiot. Who the fuck do
you think... Oh, now, oh now it's not so funny? Now you can shut up? Now you can
fucking shut the fuck up? Oh it's not funny now? The quiet that you are right now, that's
how you fucking stay."
—
Lola Glaudini, Powerful Truth Angels, "Episode 177", [352]
While noting that this was her first day of her first studio film ever and that she had been excited to
work with Depp, whom she then idolized, Glaudini said that the incident left her almost in
tears.[350] She further added that Depp later offered her a "non-apology apology" by blaming the
incident on the "Boston accent" that he was doing for the film.[350][351] In response to Glaudini's
accusation, Depp, through a representative, said that he values good relationships with his
coworkers.[350] In addition, Sam Sarkar—a sound technician on Blow who has worked on several
of Depp's films including Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Choclat, Mortdecai, and Minamata—
said that, during the filming of Blow, he never heard anything like what Glaudini recounted.[351]
Depp has struggled with substance abuse for much of his life. He has stated that he began using
drugs by taking his mother's "nerve pills" at the age of 11, was smoking at age 12 and by the age of
14 had used "every kind of drugs there were".[353][354] In a 1997 interview, Depp acknowledged
past abuse of alcohol during the filming of What's Eating Gilbert Grape? (1993).[353] In a 2008
interview, Depp stated that he had "poisoned" himself with alcohol "for years".[353] In 2013, Depp
declared that he had stopped drinking alcohol, adding that he "pretty much got everything [he]
could get out of it"; Depp also said, "I investigated wine and spirits thoroughly, and they certainly
investigated me as well, and we found out that we got along beautifully, but maybe too well."[355]
Regarding his breakup with longtime partner Vanessa Paradis, Depp said that he "definitely wasn't
going to rely on the drink to ease things or cushion the blow or cushion the situation ...[because]
that could have been fatal".[355] In a 2018 Rolling Stone profile of Depp, reporter Stephen Rodrick
Alcohol and drug use
4/24/25, 8:30 PM Johnny Depp - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_
Depp 19/55
wrote that he had used hashish in his presence and described him as "alternately hilarious, sly and
incoherent"; Depp also said that the allegation made by his former business managers that he had
spent US$30,000 per month on wine was "insulting" because he had spent "far more" than that
amount.[260] During his 2020 libel trial, Depp admitted to having been addicted to Roxicodone
and to having misused alcohol. He also admitted to using other substances such as marijuana,
MDMA and cocaine but denied ever having been addicted to any of them.[356][357][358][359]
In November 2016, Depp joined the campaign Imprisoned for Art to call for the release of
Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who was being held in custody in Russia.[360]
At the Glastonbury Festival 2017, Depp, criticizing President Donald Trump, asked: "When was the
last time an actor assassinated a president? I want to clarify: I'm not an actor. I lie for a living.
However, it's been a while and maybe it's time. I'm not insinuating anything." The comment was
interpreted as a reference to John Wilkes Booth, the actor who assassinated Abraham Lincoln.
Shawn Holtzclaw of the Secret Service told CNN they were aware of Depp's comment, but that "for
security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of
how we perform our protective responsibilities".[361][362] Depp apologized shortly afterward,
saying the remark "did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice".[363]
According to the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, Depp's most critically and commercially
successful films include A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Edward Scissorhands (1990), Arizona
Dream (1993), What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Ed Wood (1994), Donnie Brasco (1997),
Sleepy Hollow (1999), Chocolat (2000), Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
(2003), Finding Neverland (2004), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Sweeney Todd:
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), Public Enemies (2009), Alice in Wonderland (2010),
Black Mass (2015) and Minamata (2020). His films have grossed $8 billion worldwide.[364]
Depp has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following
performances:
76th Academy Awards (2004): Best Actor, nomination, for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse
of the Black Pearl[365]
77th Academy Awards (2005): Best Actor, nomination, for Finding Neverland[366]
80th Academy Awards (2008): Best Actor, nomination, for Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber
of Fleet Street[367]
Depp has won a Golden Globe Award Best Actor — Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Sweeney

Actor for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.[369] Depp has also received an
Honorary César in 1999.[370]

"Yet [Disney] has the gall and
audacity to knowingly cast a non-Native person in the role of an established Native character.
... American Indians in Film and Television's argument is not so much with Johnny Depp, a
charlatan at his best, as it is with the machinations of Disney proper. The controversy that will
haunt this endeavor and ultimately cause its demise at the box office is the behind-the-scenes
concerted effort and forced manipulation by Disney to attempt to sell Johnny Depp as an
American Indian. American Indians, as assimilated and mainstream as they may be today,
remain adamantly resistant to anyone who falsely claims to be one of theirs."

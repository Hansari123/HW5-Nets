(2005), Through the Wormhole (2010–2017), The
Story of God with Morgan Freeman (2016–2019),
Our Universe (2022) and Life on Our Planet (2023).
He made his directorial debut with the drama
Bopha! (1993). He founded the film production company Revelations Entertainment with business
partner Lori McCreary in 1996, under which they produced numerous projects, including the CBS
political drama Madam Secretary from 2014 to 2019.
Freeman was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee.
[4] He is the son of Mamie Edna (née
Revere; 1912–2000), a teacher,[5] and Morgan Porterfield Freeman (July 6, 1915 – April 27,
1961),[2] a barber, who died of cirrhosis in 1961.[6] He has three older siblings.[7] Some of Morgan's
great-great-grandparents were slaves who migrated from North Carolina to Mississippi. He later
discovered that his white maternal great-great-grandfather had lived with and was buried beside
Freeman's black great-great-grandmother in the segregated South, as the two could not legally
marry at the time.[5] The DNA test suggested that among all of his African ancestors, a little over
one-quarter came from the area that stretches from present-day Senegal to Liberia and three-
quarters came from the Congo-Angola region.[8]
As an infant, Freeman was sent to his paternal grandmother in Charleston, Mississippi.
[9][10] He
moved frequently during his childhood, living in Greenwood, Mississippi, Gary, Indiana, and
finally Chicago.
[10] He made his acting debut aged nine, playing the lead role in a school play. He
then attended Broad Street High School, a building which serves today as Threadgill Elementary
School in Greenwood.[11] At the age of 12, he won a statewide drama competition, and while
settling into school, discovered music and theater. When Freeman was 16 years old, he contracted
pneumonia.
[12]
Freeman graduated high school in 1955, but turned down a partial drama scholarship from
Jackson State University, opting instead to enlist in the United States Air Force.
[6] He served as an
Automatic Tracking Radar repairman, rising to the rank of airman first class.
[13] After serving from
1955 to 1959, he moved to Los Angeles and took acting classes at the Pasadena Playhouse.
[6] He
also studied theater arts at Los Angeles City College, where a teacher encouraged him to embark on
a dance career.[14]
Freeman worked as a dancer at the 1964 World's Fair and was a member of the Opera Ring
musical theater group in San Francisco.[15] He acted in a touring company version of The Royal
Hunt of the Sun, and also appeared as an extra in Sidney Lumet's 1965 drama film The
Pawnbroker starring Rod Steiger.
[15] Between acting and dancing jobs, Freeman realized that
acting was where his heart lay. "After [The Royal Hunt of the Sun], my acting career just took off",
he later recalled.[15] Freeman made his Off-Broadway debut in 1967, opposite Viveca Lindfors in
The Niggerlovers, a show about the Freedom Riders during the American Civil Rights

Movement,
[16] before debuting on Broadway in 1968's all-black version of Hello, Dolly! that also
starred Pearl Bailey and Cab Calloway.
[17] In 1969, Freeman also performed on stage in The
Dozens.
[18]
Beginning in 1971, Freeman starred in the PBS children's television show The Electric Company,
which gave him financial stability and recognition among American audiences.[10] His work on the
show was tiring, so he quit in 1975.[14] Television producer Joan Ganz Cooney said that Freeman
loathed appearing in The Electric Company, saying "it was a very unhappy period in his life".[19]
Freeman later acknowledged that he does not think about the show, but he was grateful to have
been a part of it.[20] His first credited appearance in a feature film was in 1971's Who Says I Can't
Ride a Rainbow!, a family drama starring Jack Klugman.
[18] Also that year, Freeman performed in
a theater production of Purlie.
[21] After a short career break, he returned to work in 1978,
appearing in two stage productions: 1978's The Mighty Gents, winning a Drama Desk Award and a
Clarence Derwent Award for his role as a wino,
[22] and White Pelicans.[23] Freeman continued to
work in theater and a year later, appeared in the Shakespearean tragedies Coriolanus, receiving
the Obie Award in 1980 for the title role[15] as well as Julius Caesar.
[24]
In 1980, he had a small role as Walter in the drama Brubaker, which starred Robert Redford as a
prison warden.[25] Freeman next appeared in the television film, Attica (1980), which is about the
1971 Attica Prison riot and its aftermath.[26] A year later he had a lead role in Peter Yates'
Eyewitness with co-stars William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.
[27] From 1982 to 1984, Freeman
was a cast member of the soap opera Another World, playing architect Roy Bingham.[28] After
several small roles in dramas, he starred in Marie (1985), a film adaptation of Marie: A True Story
by Peter Maas; he portrayed Charles Traughber.[29] He also appeared in the miniseries The Atlanta
Child Murders.
[30] Freeman also had a small role in the drama That Was Then... This Is Now,
based on the novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton.
[31] In the mid-1980s, he began accepting
prominent supporting roles in feature films, earning him a reputation for depicting wise, fatherly
characters.[10]
In addition to television films, in 1987, Freeman played a violent street hustler, a role that diverged
from his previous roles, in Street Smart co-starring Christopher Reeve and Kathy Baker.
Freeman's performance was praised by film critics, including Roger Ebert who wrote: "Freeman
has the flashier role, as a smart, very tough man who can be charming or intimidating-whatever's
needed ... Freeman creates such an unforgettable villain."[32] Freeman's performance earned him
an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
[33] He later said that he considered
Street Smart to be his breakthrough role.
[20] In his next film, he played Craig in the drama Clean
and Sober with co-stars Michael Keaton and Kathy Baker. Although the film was not a box-office
hit, it gained fair reviews; Roger Ebert gave the film 41⁄2 out of 5 stars and called the performances
"superb".[34] Freeman also received Obie Awards for his roles as a preacher in the musical The
Gospel at Colonus, and as Hoke Colburn in the play Driving Miss Daisy, respectively.[15]
Freeman had four film releases in 1989. In the first, he starred as Sergeant Major John Rawlins in
Glory, directed by Edward Zwick, about the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, the Union
Army's second African-American regiment in the American Civil War. Writing for The Washington
Post, Desson Thomson praised Freeman and co-star Denzel Washington for their "warming sense
of fraternity".[35] Glory was nominated for five Academy Awards and won three: Best Supporting
Actor for Washington, Best Cinematography, and Best Sound.

comedy-drama Driving Miss Daisy, alongside Jessica Tandy and
Dan Aykroyd. Based on Alfred Uhry's play of the same name in
which Freeman had appeared previously, he reprises his role of Hoke
Colburn, chauffeur for a Jewish widow. The film was a commercial
success and grossed US$145 million worldwide.[37] Film critics were
mainly positive; Henry Sheehan from The Hollywood Reporter
opined that Freeman and Tandy's performances complemented each
other while retaining their "individual star-quality".[38] The film was
nominated for nine Academy Awards (and received four, Best Picture
being one of them), including Best Actor for Freeman.[36]
His third release was the biographical drama Lean on Me, in which
he portrays the principal of an under-performing and drug- and
crime-ridden New Jersey high school. Jane Galbraith of Variety
magazine thought Freeman's casting was "wonderful".[39] Lastly in
1989, he starred in Walter Hill's Johnny Handsome, a crime drama in which he plays a New
Orleans police officer.[40] In a 1990 interview, Freeman said that Glory was one of his favorite
releases—"The Black legacy is as noble, is as heroic, is as filled with adventure and conquest and
discovery as anybody else's. It's just that nobody knows it."[14] In 1990, Freeman provided the
voice of Frederick Douglass in The Civil War, a television miniseries about the American Civil
War.[41] In the same year he starred in the critically panned The Bonfire of the Vanities. According
to the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 16% based on 51
reviews.[42] In the summer of 1990, he played Petruchio, a role he had been thinking about for six
years, in Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, which opened at Delacorte theater in New York
City. "[Petruchio] seems to have a lot of fun in life", he said.[43] In 1991, Freeman had a supporting
role in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, an action-adventure starring Kevin Costner. The film was a
commercial success,[44] but garnered mixed reviews from critics; The New York Times' Vincent
Canby thought Freeman played Azeem with "wit and humor" despite the "muddled" plot.[45]
Freeman also narrated The True Story of Glory Continues, a
documentary about the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment.[46]
In 1992, he appeared in Clint Eastwood's western Unforgiven,
which won four Academy Awards including Best Picture.
[47] The
film depicts William Munny (Eastwood), an aging outlaw and killer
who takes on one more job with old friend Ned Logan (Freeman).
Unforgiven was widely acclaimed, with one critic calling Freeman's
performance "outstanding".[48] Also in 1992 Freeman starred in the
John G. Avildsen directed drama The Power of One acting opposite
Stephen Dorf and John Gielgud in a loose adaptation of Bryce
Courtenay's 1989 novel of the same name, in which he plays boxing
coach Geel Piet.[49] In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut
with the drama Bopha!, which tells the story of a black policeman
(Danny Glover) during South Africa's apartheid era. Bopha! was
well-received, in particular for Freeman's directing. Hal Hinson of
The Washington Post wrote: "Freeman lays out the father-son
dynamics with great skill and very little fuss. There's no hysteria in his approach; instead, he sticks
to the facts, relying on his cast to provide the emotion. The result is a surprisingly powerful,
insightful film."[50] Kenneth Turan from Los Angeles Times also complimented Freeman's
direction but thought the film was "more predictable than powerful".[51]

In 1994, Freeman portrayed Red, the redeemed convict in Frank Darabont's acclaimed drama The
Shawshank Redemption, with co-star Tim Robbins. It is based on the 1982 Stephen King novella
Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Freeman was cast at the suggestion of producer Liz
Glotzer, despite the novella's character of a white Irishman.[52] Filming proved to be challenging,
mainly because of Darabont's need for multiple takes. Freeman said, "The answer [I'd give him]
was no ... having to do something again and again for no discernible reason tends to be a bit
debilitating to the energy."[52] Nevertheless, his performance was described as "quietly impressive"
and "moving" by The New York Times.
[53] At the 67th Academy Awards the film received Academy
Award nominations for Best Picture and a nomination for Freeman for Best Actor losing to Tom
Hanks in Forrest Gump (1994).[54] Since its release, The Shawshank Redemption has remained
popular among audiences.[52] In 1994, Freeman served as a member of the jury at the 44th Berlin
International Film Festival.
[55]
Outbreak (1995), a medical thriller directed by Wolfgang Petersen, was Freeman's next film. He
played General Billy Ford, a doctor dealing with an outbreak of a fictional virus in a small town.
The film stars Dustin Hoffman, Rene Russo, and Donald Sutherland. Outbreak was a box-office
success, grossing $189.8 million worldwide,[56] but gained a mixed critics' response.[57] Mick
LaSelle of the San Francisco Chronicle credited Freeman for his performance which may have
been unappreciated by viewers.[58] In 1995, Freeman starred with Brad Pitt in David Fincher's
crime thriller Seven, the story of two detectives who attempt to identify a serial killer who bases his
murders on the Christian seven deadly sins. Freeman's performance generated a positive response;
Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote: "Freeman plays nearly every scene in a doleful
hush; he makes you lean in to hear his words, to ferret out the hints of anger and regret that haunt
this weary knight."[59] The critic from Variety magazine called Freeman's acting "supremely
nuanced".[60]
While filming Outbreak, Freeman expressed an interest in starting a film production company. He
turned to McCreary, the producer of Bopha!, to be his business partner. Freeman explained that he
wanted to achieve representation on screen, explore challenging issues and reveal hidden truths, so
they chose to name their firm Revelations Entertainment.
[61] A year later, he appeared in Chain
Reaction as Paul Shannon, a science-fiction thriller co-starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz.
The film was a critical and commercial disappointment.[62][63] Next, he was cast opposite Robin
Wright in 1996's Moll Flanders, a period drama based on the novel of the same name. The film
received a mixed reception; Greg Evans from Variety magazine said Freeman gave a "sweet"
performance,[64] while The New York Times critic thought he was miscast.[65]
In 1997, Freeman narrated the Academy Award-winning documentary The Long Way Home,
about Jewish refugees' liberation after World War II and the establishment of Israel.
[23] He also
appeared in Steven Spielberg's historical epic Amistad alongside Djimon Hounsou, Anthony
Hopkins, and Matthew McConaughey. Based on the events in 1839 aboard the slave ship La
Amistad, the film was mostly well-received and earned four nominations at the Academy
Awards.[66][67] The critic from Salon magazine, however, thought the film lacked inspiration and
Freeman's role was "utterly cryptic".[68] In that same year, he was cast as psychologist Alex Cross
in Kiss the Girls, a thriller based on James Patterson's 1995 novel of the same name. In a mixed
review, Peter Stack of San Francisco Chronicle thought Freeman and co-star Ashley Judd gave
strong performances despite the lengthy plot.[69]

Film Festival
Freeman went on to star in Deep Impact (1998), a science-fiction
disaster film in which he played President Tim Beck.[70] The story
depicts humanity's attempt to destroy a 7-mile (11 km) wide comet
set to collide with Earth and cause a mass extinction. The film was a
box-office hit, despite competition from Armageddon, another
summer blockbuster of the year.[71] Continuing with the disaster
genre, he then starred opposite Christian Slater in 1998's Hard
Rain, centering on a heist and man-made treachery amidst a
natural disaster in a small Indiana town. The film was unpopular
with critics; Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times called
the characters "one-dimensional" and the film "routine".[72]
Freeman returned to the screen in 2000 with the lead role of
Charlie in the comedy Nurse Betty, featuring Renée Zellweger,
Chris Rock, and Greg Kinnear. The film premiered at the Cannes
Film Festival to mainly positive reviews; the critic from Variety
magazine thought Freeman and Rock had "wonderful
chemistry".[73] Next, he appeared in Under Suspicion (2000), a
thriller remake of the 1981 French film Garde à vue. The film had been "carting round" for twelve
years before Freeman was able to produce it under Revelations Entertainment.[74] He co-starred
with Gene Hackman; "Working with Gene was wonderful. I didn't find it too hard working with an
icon I so respected", Freeman said.[74] Upon release, Under Suspicion was met with lukewarm
reception;[75] CNN's Paul Tatara praised the actors but thought the film was "too tawdry to be
completely entertaining, and too static to generate much excitement".[76]
In 2001, Freeman reprised his role of Alex Cross in Along Came a
Spider, a sequel to 1997's Kiss the Girls. The film received mixed-to-
negative reviews.[77] Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today observed that
"Freeman strides with noble authority" but thought the overall film
was unmemorable.[78] In 2002, Freeman was cast opposite Ben
Affleck in the spy thriller The Sum of All Fears. It is based on Tom
Clancy's 1991 novel of the same name, about a plot by an Austrian
Neo-Nazi to trigger a nuclear war between the United States and
Russia, so that he can establish a fascist superstate in Europe. The
Sum of All Fears received moderate reviews,[79] but was a
commercial success, grossing $193.9 million worldwide.[80] Next,
Freeman starred alongside Ashley Judd and Jim Caviezel in High
Crimes (2002), a legal thriller based on Joseph Finder's 1998 novel
of the same name. The story follows lawyer Claire (Judd), whose
husband (Caviezel) is arrested and placed on trial for the murder of villagers while he was in the
Marines. Although several critics were unimpressed with the story, they credited Freeman and
Judd for their chemistry and performances.[81][82] In 2003, Freeman appeared as God in the hit
comedy Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston.
[83]
Next, he starred in the science fiction horror Dreamcatcher, adapted from Stephen King's 2001
novel of the same name. The film was a box-office flop,[84] and garnered mostly negative reviews;
Dreamcatcher has an approval rating of 28% on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.[85] Also in
2003, Freeman starred in two other dramas that were not widely seen, Levity and Guilty by
Association.
[86][87] His 2004 releases were comedy The Big Bounce and sports drama Million
Dollar Baby.
[88][89] In the latter, directed by Clint Eastwood, Freeman portrayed an elderly former

boxer. The film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress
(Hilary Swank), and Best Supporting Actor, earning Freeman his first Academy Award.[10]
Freeman was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the same category.[90] Roger Ebert
complimented Freeman's "flat and factual" narration,[91] and Timeout magazine thought the cast
fully inhabited their roles.[92]
Freeman made six appearances in various films in 2005. In the
drama An Unfinished Life, Freeman plays Mitch, a neighbor of a
Wyoming rancher (Robert Redford). The film had a mixed response;
The Guardian critic thought it was amiable but questioned the
purpose of Freeman's "sidekick" role.[93] Freeman's authoritative
voice led to his narration of two documentaries; Steven Spielberg's
War of the Worlds and the Academy Award-winning March of the
Penguins.
[23] He also appeared in Christopher Nolan's Batman
Begins, the first installment in what would become The Dark Knight
Trilogy, as the fictional Lucius Fox.
[94] After this, he co-starred with
Jet Li in the action-thriller Unleashed, playing Sam, a blind piano
tuner who helps Li's character turn his life around. The film gained a
mixed-to-positive reception; Peter Hartlaub of San Francisco
Chronicle was confused with the genre and thought Freeman's
character interrupted the narrative.
[95] Freeman's next role was in the thriller Edison, which
bombed at the box office.[96] In his last release of 2005, he provided the voice of Neil Armstrong in
the documentary Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D.
[97]
Freeman starred in 2006's The Contract, as assassin Frank Carden opposite John Cusack. The film
was released direct-to-video, which critic John Cornelius suggests was unsurprising, considering
the generic formula of the thriller.[98] Freeman next appeared in Lucky Number Slevin (2006), a
crime thriller directed by Paul McGuigan. Starring a principal cast of Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis,
Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, and Ben Kingsley, the film garnered mixed reception.[99] David Mattin of
BBC wrote: "Kingsley and Freeman shine individually, but their inevitable, climactic clash of heads
lacks force. Like its leading man [Hartnett], this movie presents a charming façade with nothing
much underneath."[100] Next, Freeman portrayed himself in the low-budget comedy 10 Items or
Less opposite Paz Vega.
[101] Two weeks after its theatrical release, 10 Items or Less was made
available for download from ClickStar, a film distribution company that Freeman co-founded that
year.[102]
In 2007, Freeman reprised his role as God in Evan Almighty, a sequel to 2003's Bruce Almighty,
with Steve Carell. Evan Almighty was a box-office failure[103] and negatively received;[104] The
Guardian critic wrote: "A cast full of people who have been frequently funny elsewhere flounder in
this deluge of sentimentality and CGI. Avoid like the Ten Plagues."[105] The drama Feast of Love
was Freeman's second release of 2007. It is based on the 2000 novel The Feast of Love by Charles
Baxter, about a group of friends living in suburban Oregon who come into contact with a free spirit
who changes their outlook on life; Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian sarcastically remarked that it
was great to see Freeman in a challenging role.[106] Freeman had a supporting part in Gone Baby
Gone (2007), a mystery thriller that was also Ben Affleck's directorial debut. Adapted from the
1998 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, Freeman plays Captain Jack Doyle of the Boston
Police Department. The story and cast performances were positively received; Time Out magazine

Freeman was nominated for an
Academy Award for Best Actor
for his portrayal of Nelson
Mandela (pictured) in the film
Invictus (2009)
called it "flawed but impressive".[107] Afterward, he starred in Rob Reiner's 2007 comedy The
Bucket List opposite Jack Nicholson.
[108] The plot follows two terminally ill men on a road trip
with a list of things to do before they die. The film grossed $175 million worldwide.[109]
In 2008, Freeman was cast in the action-thriller Wanted, a loose
adaptation of the comic book miniseries by Mark Millar and J. G.
Jones. The plot revolves around Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), a
frustrated account manager who discovers that he is the son of a
professional assassin and decides to join the Fraternity, a secret
society of which Sloan (Freeman) is the leader. Principal
photography took place in Chicago; co-star rapper Common
remarked on the set atmosphere: "Freeman is a cool guy. He'd be
walking around joking and singing and just dancing. You know,
artists are free and I just felt the freedom in him."[110] The film
received generally favorable reviews; Peter Howell of Toronto Star
thought it was original and one of Freeman's bolder performances
to date.[111] Freeman narrated The Love Guru (2008),[112] before
appearing in The Dark Knight (2008), the second installment of
Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, in which he reprised his
role as Lucius Fox.[113] Freeman returned to Broadway in 2008
after an eighteen-year absence to co-star with Frances McDormand
and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets' play, The Country Girl,
directed by Mike Nichols.
[114]
Freeman continued to accept roles in a diverse range of genres. In 2009, Freeman starred opposite
Antonio Banderas in the heist movie Thick as Thieves.
[115] Next, he collaborated with Christopher
Walken and William H. Macy for the comedy The Maiden Heist. For some time, Freeman
expressed a desire to do a film based on Nelson Mandela. Initially, he wanted to adapt Mandela's
autobiography Long Walk to Freedom into a screenplay, but plans were never finalized.[116]
Instead, he purchased the film rights to John Carlin's book: Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela
and the Game That Made a Nation.
[117] The book was adapted into a film which Clint Eastwood
directed, Invictus, starring Freeman as Mandela and Matt Damon as rugby team captain Francois
Pienaar.
[118] The biographical drama received positive reviews for Freeman's performance; Roger
Ebert wrote: "Freeman does a splendid job of evoking the man Nelson Mandela ... He shows him as
genial, confident, calming, over what was clearly a core of tempered steel."[119] Freeman received
Best Actor nominations at the Academy Awards and Golden Globes, as well as a nomination for
Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.[120][121][122] The
same year he provided the narration for Janet Langhart's Anne and Emmett, a play featuring an
imaginary conversation between Emmett Till and Anne Frank, both killed as young teenagers
because of racial persecution.[123]
Freeman's sole film release of 2010 was Red with co-stars Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, and John
Malkovich.
[124] Red is loosely adapted from the comic-book series Red, created by Warren Ellis
and Cully Hamner and published by the DC Comics imprint Homage. Freeman plays CIA mentor
Joe, who helps retired fellow agent Frank (Willis) to uncover some assassins. The film was a
critical and commercial success;[125] writing for Melbourne's The Age, Jim Schembri praised
Freeman and the cast who "bring an infectious comic energy to their roles".[126]

Besides film, Freeman worked on other projects. In January 2010, he
replaced Walter Cronkite as the voiceover introduction to the CBS
Evening News presented by Katie Couric.
[127] CBS gave the need for
consistency in introductions for regular news broadcasts and special
reports as the basis for the change.[127] Deborah Myers, head of
Science Channel, approached Freeman to be the presenter of Through
the Wormhole (2010–17). She had heard that he was "really interested
in space and the universe", and the pair agreed to develop the series
together.[128]
In 2011, Freeman narrated the fantasy Conan the Barbarian and
appeared in the family drama Dolphin Tale, as prosthetic specialist

[134]
A number of box office hits were released in 2013. Freeman appeared in the action-thriller

Niro, Kevin Kline, and Mary Steenburgen.
[139] Filmed in Las Vegas and Atlanta,
[140] Last Vegas
was praised for its cast's chemistry, and one critic thought Freeman brought the most
amusement.[141]
In 2014, Freeman voiced the character Vitruvius in The Lego Movie, a commercially successful 3D
animation.[142] He starred in Transcendence, a science fiction thriller directed by Wally Pfister in
his directorial debut, in which Freeman plays scientist Joseph Tagger. Critic reviews of the film
were generally mixed, according to Metacritic.
[143] Next, he co-starred in the action Lucy (2014),
about a woman (Scarlett Johansson) who gains psychokinetic abilities when a nootropic drug is
absorbed into her bloodstream. Freeman plays Professor Samuel Norman, who helps her research
the condition. Producer Virginie Silla wanted Freeman for the part because of his experience in
portraying a character of wisdom.[144] "He was the perfect actor", she said.[144] Upon the release of
Lucy, critical reception ranged from mixed-to-positive.[145] In the same year Freeman appeared in
Dolphin Tale 2, the sequel to 2011's Dolphin Tale,
[146] and 5 Flights Up, a comedy-drama.[147] At

Kazuaki Kiriya's action-thriller Last Knights was Freeman's first
film of 2015, starring opposite Clive Owen. The plot centers on a
band of warriors who seek to avenge the loss of their master at the
hands of a corrupt minister. Reviews were largely
underwhelming;[149] Sara Stewart of New York Post called it
"bloody bad", adding: "Once-proud box office names are its first
casualties."[150] Freeman next joined the cast of Ted 2, a comedy
sequel to Ted, directed by Seth MacFarlane. The story follows the
talking teddy bear Ted as he fights for civil rights in order to be
recognized as a person. Freeman portrays Patrick Meighan, a highly
respected civil rights attorney.[151] A television series, Madam
Secretary, also occupied Freeman's time. He played Chief Justice
Frawley of the United States Supreme Court in a recurring role in
the series. He and his producing partner Lori McCreary were
executive producers.[152] Freeman directed the first episode;
McCreary remarked of his directing style, "What's riveting is that he
can achieve a complete tonal change in performance with the least
amount of direction ... Everybody behaves better when Morgan is there ... but he's very fun."[153] At
the end of 2015, Freeman played a U.S. senator in the thriller Momentum.
[154]
Reprising his role as Allan Trumbull, Freeman appeared in London Has Fallen, the 2016 sequel to

attend the British Prime Minister's funeral in London, as well as Secret Service agent Mike
Banning's efforts to protect U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) from being killed. The
film was a commercial success;[155] however, writing for The A.V. Club, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky
criticized the cheap filmmaking, saying: "The movie periodically cuts to overqualified supporting
actors—including Freeman, Melissa Leo, and Robert Forster ... (As it turns out, it's possible to
write something that will sound like garbage even when spoken in Freeman's sonorous voice.)"[156]
Next, Freeman reprised his role as Thaddeus Bradley, starring in Now You See Me 2 (2016),[157]
the sequel to Now You See Me, the sequel grossing a successful $334.9 million worldwide.[158]
Finally, he had a leading role in the historical drama Ben-Hur, the fifth film adaptation of the 1880
novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ by Lew Wallace. Freeman expressed interest in playing Sheik
Ilderim, a wealthy Nubian sheik, stating: "This character has quite a bit of power in the story. And I
like playing power. It's something about my own personal ego."[159] Ben-Hur turned out to be one
of 2016's biggest box-office bombs.
[160][161]
In 2017, Freeman appeared in two comedies: Going in
Style and Just Getting Started. The first one is a remake of
the 1979 film with the same name, co-starring Michael
Caine and Alan Arkin; in it they play bank robbers after
their pensions are canceled.[162] It opened to a mixed
response;[163] The Telegraph's Robbie Collin thought the
trio of actors looked tired before the end of it.[164] Just
Getting Started, in which Freeman starred with Tommy
Lee Jones and Rene Russo, was critically panned by
reviewers.[165] The plot follows an ex-FBI agent (Jones)
who must put aside his personal feud with a former mob

Fallen, Freeman reprised his role as Allan Trumbull, the third installment in the Has Fallen film

mixed,[170] the film was a box office success, earning $147.5 million worldwide.[171]
Freeman next appeared alongside an ensemble cast in George Gallo's crime comedy The Comeback

In 2005, Freeman criticized the celebration of Black History Month, saying: "I don't want a black
history month. Black history is American history."[184] He opined that the only way to end racism
is to stop talking about it, and he noted that there is no "white history month".[184] In an interview
with 60 Minutes's Mike Wallace, Freeman said: "I am going to stop calling you a white man and
I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man."[184][185] Freeman supported the defeated
proposal to change the Mississippi state flag, which incorporated the Confederate battle flag at the
time.[186][187] In an interview on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, Freeman drew controversy when
he accused the Tea Party movement of racism.[188][189][190] Regarding the 2015 Baltimore protests,
Freeman said he was "absolutely" supportive of the protesters. "That unrest [in Baltimore] has
nothing to do with terrorism at all, except the terrorism we suffer from the police ... Because of the
technology—everybody has a smartphone—now in reaction to the death of Freddie Gray we can see
what the police are doing. We can show the world, 'Look, this is what happened in that situation.'
So why are so many people dying in police custody? And why are they all Black? And why are all
the police killing them white? What is that? The police have always said, 'I feared for my safety.'
Well, now we know. OK. You feared for your safety while a guy was running away from you,
right?"[191]
During the 2008 presidential election, Freeman endorsed Barack Obama's presidential bid,
although he said he would not join Obama's campaign.[192] He provided the voice of the narrator
for Disney World's The Hall of Presidents when Obama was added to the exhibit,[193][194] and
when The Hall of Presidents re-opened on July 4, 2009, at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando,
Florida.

[195][196]
On September 19, 2017, Freeman appeared in a video by the Committee to Investigate Russia
group,[197][198] in which he declared "we [United States] are at war" and accusing Russia of
"launching cyber attacks and spreading false information".[199][200] Freeman also endorsed his
friend Bill Luckett, who unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Mississippi in 2011.[201]
In June 2021, he and Linda Keena, a professor at University of Mississippi, donated $1 million to
the university, establishing the Center for Evidence-Based Policing and Reform.[202]

Hines was murdered in New York City.[209]
Freeman resides in Charleston, Mississippi, and maintains
a home in New York City.[210][211] He earned a private
pilot's license at the age of 65[212] and owns—or has owned
—at least three private aircraft, including both a Cessna
Citation 501 and Cessna 414 as well as an Emivest
SJ30.
[213][214][215]
In December 2010, Freeman joined former President Bill
Clinton, president of the United States Soccer Federation
Sunil Gulati, and soccer player Landon Donovan in Zurich for a presentation to bid for the U.S.
hosting rights for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
[216] Freeman's favorite film that he did not work on is
Moulin Rouge!.
[217] He later reaffirmed this during his tribute speech at Nicole Kidman's AFI Life
Achievement Award ceremony.[218]
When asked if he believed in God, Freeman said: "It's a hard question because as I said at the start,
I think we invented God. So if I believe in God, and I do, it's because I think I'm God."[219] He later
said that his experience working on The Story of God with Morgan Freeman did not change his
views on religion.[220] In 2019, it was reported that Freeman found religion in Zoroastrianism.
[221]
On the evening of August 3, 2008, Freeman was injured in an automobile crash when his 1997
Nissan Maxima was involved in a rollover near Ruleville, Mississippi. He and his passenger,
Demaris Meyer, had to be cut free from the vehicle with hydraulic tools. Freeman was conscious
after the crash and joked with a photographer at the scene.[222] He was taken via helicopter to The
Regional Medical Center (The Med) hospital in Memphis.[223][224] His left shoulder, arm, and
elbow had been broken in the accident, and he received surgery on August 5. Doctors operated on
him for four hours to repair nerve damage in his shoulder and arm.[225] His publicist announced
he was expected to make a full recovery.[226] Although alcohol was not considered a factor in the
crash,[227] Meyer sued Freeman for negligence, claiming that he had been consuming alcohol, but
the suit was eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.[228] Since the incident, Freeman suffers
from fibromyalgia,
[229] for which he wears a compression glove that supports blood
circulation.[230]
On May 24, 2018, CNN published an investigation in which eight women accused Freeman of
"what some called harassment and others called inappropriate behavior".[231] In response,
Freeman made the statement, "Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not

anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected — that was never my intent."[232][233] One of the
women named as an accuser, Tyra Martin, spoke out against her portrayal in CNN's report, saying,
"I'm not, never was [a victim]. CNN totally misrepresented the video and took my remarks out of
context." According to Essence, Martin "saw many of his [Freeman] comments, though
inappropriate, to be said in jest."[234] Freeman's lawyer demanded CNN retract the story.[235] After
a period of deliberation, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) decided not to take any action against
Freeman.[236]
Freeman's deep voice is considered to be distinctive, iconic, and
recognizable which frequently makes him a preferable choice for
narration in films and documentaries.[237][238] The journalist
Radhika Sanghani writes that his "deeply reassuring voice, with its
mellifluous tones and authoritative presence, is why an entire
generation still hear his trademark tones when they think of the
almighty".[239] Freeman said that his voice developed in this way
while taking speech classes in college; he found that most people
speak in a voice either too fast or too high and he developed a
commanding voice by speaking in a lower octave and enunciating
each word.[240]
According to author Miriam DeCosta-Willis, Freeman is an
intuitive actor. He likes to select his roles carefully, and study the
character to ensure he portrays them with depth, sensitivity, and
substance.[241] Commenting on Freeman's persona, Beverly Todd,
who co-starred with him in Lean on Me (1989) and The Bucket List
(2007) said: "The world knows he is such a consummate actor. He's a very sharing actor and such a
nice guy. He's not the kind of actor who demands that he has all of the scenes and all the dialogues
and all the emphasis is on him".[242] Freeman has said he is interested in playing character
roles[15] and values the importance of listening carefully while filming scenes: "The big danger in
acting is to wait for your line. That's what I never do. I always listen, no matter how many times we
do it."[243]
On October 28, 2006, Freeman was honored at the first Mississippi's Best Awards in Jackson,
Mississippi with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his work in film and theater. He received an
honorary Doctor of Arts and Letters degree from Delta State University during the school's
commencement exercises on May 13, 2006.[244] In 2013, Boston University presented him with an
honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.[245] On November 12, 2014, he was bestowed the
honor of Freedom of the City by the City of London.
[246]
In 2008, Freeman was chosen as a Kennedy Center Honoree at the John F. Kennedy Center in
Washington D.C.[247] In 2011, he received the AFI Life Achievement Award in recognition of his
contribution to the film industry. Those who honored Freeman included Sidney Poitier, Samuel L.
Jackson, Forest Whitaker, Rita Moreno, Helen Mirren, Clint Eastwood, Cuba Gooding Jr., and
Matthew Broderick.
[248] In 2012, he was awarded the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, which
recognizes lifetime achievement in the film industry.[249][250] In August 2017, he was named the

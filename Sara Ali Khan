Sara Ali Khan Pataudi (pronounced [saːɾa əˈli xaːn]; born 12 August 1995) is an Indian actress who works in Hindi films. Born into the Pataudi family, she is the daughter of actors Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan. After graduating with a degree in history and political science from Columbia University, Khan began her acting career in 2018 with the romantic drama Kedarnath and the action comedy Simmba. Both films were commercially successful, and the former earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut.

Khan appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list of 2019. Alongside several poorly received films, she starred in the drama Atrangi Re (2021) and had a commercial success in the romantic comedy Zara Hatke Zara Bachke (2023).

Early life and background
Sara Ali Khan was born on 12 August 1995[1][a] in Bombay, Maharashtra,[3] to father, Saif Ali Khan, son of Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and Sharmila Tagore, and mother, Amrita Singh, daughter of socialite Rukhsana Sultana. Both her parents are actors of the Hindi film industry.[4][5][6] Khan is of Pashtun, Assamese, and Bengali descent on her father's side, and of Punjabi descent on her mother's side.[7][8]

Khan is also the great-granddaughter of Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi and Sajida Sultan, the great-great-granddaughter of Jnanadabhiram Barua and Hamidullah Khan, the great-great-great-granddaughter of Sultan Jahan Begum, Gaganendranath Tagore and Gunabhiram Barua, and the niece of Soha Ali Khan and Saba Ali Khan.[9] She has a younger brother, Ibrahim Ali Khan, who is also an actor,[10] and two half-brothers from her father's second marriage to Kareena Kapoor.[11]

When Khan was a four-year-old, she acted in an advertisement.[12] According to Saif, actress Aishwarya Rai proved to be her inspiration for pursuing a career in film after she saw her perform on stage in Chicago.[12][13] In 2004, when Khan was nine, her parents divorced, and Singh was granted legal guardianship of her children.[14] Saif was initially not allowed to see her or her brother;[14] they have since reconciled, and, according to Saif, "are more like friends [than father and daughter]".[15] Khan also shares a healthy relationship with Kapoor, her step-mother; she stated in 2018, "I would like to imbibe her professionalism in me".[16]

As a teenager, Khan struggled with her weight, and had to undergo daily workouts under a strict schedule to get fit.[17] She was also diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, which she ascribes as a cause for her weight gain.[18] Khan studied history and political science at Columbia University in New York.[19][20][21] In 2016, she completed her graduation early, within three years, and took off the remaining 1+1⁄2 years for weight training, following which she returned to India.[21][22]

Career
Early success and setback (2018–2022)
Khan's acting debut came in 2018 with Abhishek Kapoor's romantic film Kedarnath, in which she played a Hindu girl who falls in love with a Muslim porter, played by Sushant Singh Rajput.[23] In preparation for her role, Khan improved her knowledge of Hindi vocabulary with help from Rajput.[24] Kedarnath received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan's performance.[25] Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror found it to be a rehash of 1980s Hindi films but appreciated Khan's act: "When her Mukku is angry, hopeful, desperate or coltish, she often conveys it through her eyes alone — giving us a taste of the diverse faces she can throw on."[26] Meena Iyer of Daily News and Analysis similarly labelled her "spectacular".[27] Kedarnath emerged as a commercial success with a gross of over ₹960 million (US$11 million).[28] Khan was awarded with the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut and the IIFA Award for Star Debut of the Year – Female.[29][30]


Khan with co-star Ranveer Singh promoting Simmba
A few weeks after the release of Kedarnath, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty's action film Simmba, alongside Ranveer Singh, which was loosely based on the Telugu-language film Temper (2015).[31] She began work on it when filming of Kedarnath was temporarily suspended.[32][33] This led to Abhishek Kapoor suing Khan; they later settled out of court when she agreed to split her time between both films.[34][35] Reviewing the film for The Times of India, Ronak Kotecha opined that Khan had "precious little to do besides looking breathtakingly beautiful" and disliked the chemistry between her and Singh.[36] With worldwide earnings of ₹4 billion (US$47 million), Simmba emerged as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2018.[37]

In Imtiaz Ali's romantic drama Love Aaj Kal (2020), a spiritual successor to Ali's 2009 film of the same name, Khan starred as a young woman with a troubled past, opposite Kartik Aaryan.[38][39] In a negative review of the film, Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in bemoaned that Khan "simply doesn't have the experience or the expertise" to play a complex character, adding that "having a camera shoved into her young face only enlarges her shortcomings".[40] It emerged as a box office bomb.[41] In the same year, Khan starred opposite Varun Dhawan in the comedy film Coolie No. 1, an adaptation of David Dhawan's 1995 film of the same name.[42][43][44] The film had strong viewership on Amazon Prime Video but it was unanimously panned by film critics.[45] Khan was criticised for not adding any value to the film, with Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost opining that Khan does nothing more than fill the slot of "the hero's love interest".[46]

In 2021, Khan featured as a woman with post-traumatic stress disorder in Aanand L. Rai's drama Atrangi Re, co-starring Akshay Kumar and Dhanush,[47] which premiered on Disney+ Hotstar after multiple delays due to the nationwide lockdown due to the pandemic. The film received mixed reviews from critics.[48] Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times called her the "soul" of the film and praised her acting range and her Bihari accent.[49] Conversely, in his review for Mint, Uday Bhatia criticised her "grating Bihari accent".[50]

Further fluctuations (2023–present)
Khan's next release was in 2023, in Gaslight, a whodunit that was filmed in 36 days, which also released on Disney+ Hotstar.[51] Saibal Chatterjee opined that her "earnest performance, like the rest of the film, is uneven".[52] She next played opposite Vicky Kaushal in Zara Hatke Zara Bachke, a romantic comedy about a small-town couple struggling for privacy. WION's Shomini Sen was critical of her "inconsistent performance", adding that she "overacts" in key scenes.[53] It marked her first film to release theatrically since Love Aaj Kal in 2020.[54] Against expectations, it emerged as a commercial success.[55][56]

In 2024, Khan starred alongside an ensemble cast in Homi Adajania’s murder mystery Murder Mubarak, for Netflix.[57] Anvita Singh of India Today bemoaned that Khan had gone "slightly overboard at times in a bid to sell her character [...] borderline hamming".[58] She then starred in a biopic of freedom fighter Usha Mehta, titled Ae Watan Mere Watan, for Amazon Prime Video.[59] Her performance was panned by critics,[60][61][62] such as The Indian Express's Shubhra Gupta, who dismissed her as having "little impact" in the role.[63]

Khan portrayed the pregnant wife of a missing Air Force officer (played by Veer Pahariya) in Sky Force (2025), an action film set amidst the Indo-Pakistani air war of 1965. Hindustan Times's Rishabh Suri was appreciative of the film, but wrote that Khan "gets very little screen space" and had failed to prove herself in a pivotal scene.[64] It had poor box-office returns.[65] She will next star in Anurag Basu's anthology film Metro... In Dino,[66] and in an as-yet untitled spy comedy co-starring Ayushmann Khurrana.[67]

Khan in 2021
In 2019, Khan appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list, ranking 66th with an estimated annual income of ₹57.5 million (US$670,000).[68] In 2020, Eastern Eye featured her in their dynamic dozen for the decade list.[69] In Rediff.com's "The Best Actresses" list of 2021, she ranked 9th.[70] She also ranked 7th in GQ India's listing of the 30 most influential young Indians of 2022.[71]

Khan has frequently featured in Times' 50 Most Desirable Women list. She was placed 30th in 2018, 27th in 2019 and 24th in 2020.[72][73] Khan is a celebrity endorser for several brands and products, including Fanta, Puma, Pepsi, Veet and Kurkure.[74][75] In 2022, she joined The Souled Store, a pop-culture apparel brand, as an equity partner.[76]

Apart from acting, Khan supports a number of causes.[77] During COVID-19 pandemic, Khan donated to Sonu Sood's Foundation for purchasing oxygen cylinders for those in need. In 2021, on her birthday, she teamed up with Kailash Sathyarthi Children's Foundation, for providing help to children who have been orphaned due to COVID-19.[78]
